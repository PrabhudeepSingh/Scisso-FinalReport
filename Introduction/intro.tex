\section{Overview}

Scisso App aims to solve problems of the Salon Managment and marketing across the country. The main motive of Scisso App is keeping the retention rate of the customers as high as possible by providing offers and loyalty points to the user for each purchase they make. This app will help Salon Admin to keep track of their product delivery, customer retention and Employee efficiency.\\
\\
While developing the project, i followed the industry standards of MVC i.e Model View Controller model. It follows the software engineering principles of low coupling and high cohesion. This model is followed to develop better softwares and to maintain a sustianable software product for a longer period of time.\\
\\
\textbf{What is MVC model?}\\
The MVC pattern allows separate the Controller layer from the logic, so that everything about how the interface works is separated from how we represent it on screen. \\
\\
Ideally the MVC pattern would achieve that same logic might have completely different and interchangeable views.\\
\\
\textbf{Why use MVC?}\\
In Android we have a problem arising from the fact that Android activities are closely coupled to both interface and data access mechanisms. We can find extreme examples such as Adapters, which are part of the view, with cursors, something that should be relegated to the depths of data access layer .

For an application to be easily extensible and maintainable we need to define well separated layers. What do we do tomorrow if, instead of retrieving the same data from a database, we need to do it from a web service? We would have to redo our entire view .

MVC makes views independent from our data source. We divide the application into at least three different layers, which let us test them independently. With MVC we are able to take most of logic out from the activities so that we can test it without using instrumentation tests.\\

While developing the project the main focus was that how the app will keep track of its customers and their transactions. Different API and their standard methods has been used to ensure that the app works superbly. Different latest android concepts like CardView also have been used in the project in order to have it a beautiful UI.\\
\\
The app is a total solution for the managment and marketing of a Slaon. The app allows the admin to handle the services provoided by them. The services are arranged according to the their categories. Along with services admin is allowed to handle and edit the data of their clients. Along with these facilities app also saves and have track of the employees working in the salon. Along with all these app also counts the incentives gained by the employees. These modules were from the sofware solutions that are provided by the app. The app also provide the Salon with marketing solution by rolling offers and by giving loyalty points on every purchase a customer make. 
\\

The app has a Main Activity which opens up a navigation menu and list of enabled services and current offers. The offers menu is developed in according to the customer view.
On the other hand the Navigation view is developed for the admin.
\\
\\
The Services nav item will lead the app to Services Activity where the admin can customize the services provided by them.
\\
\\
The Employees nav item intent the app to the Emploee List Activity where the admin can manage the details of the employees working in the salon.
\\
\\
The Clients nav item takes the app to Clients List Activity where the admin is allowed to perform the CRUD operations on the client and fix appointment with them.
\\
\\
The Appointements booked can be seen in by Appointments nav item.
\\
\\
The Offers nav item is for managing the offers rolling in the Salon at the current time.
\\
\\
The Redeem points module is mainly focused on the marketing sloutions of the salon. With the enough loyalty points collected a customer can get any of the current offers.
\\
\\
The Employee Accounts is for the calculation of the amount of work done by an employee in a given time.
\\
\\
Genrate receipt module generates the receipt for the services taken by a client.
\\
\\

Future of the app is to bring all the data of every salon using the app at a single database which will contain the data of all the clients from all the salon's and after gathering all the data we can analyse them and run acccording ads to the particular customer.

\section{Existing System}
No such type of Independent App exists for the Salon app managment which can provide both of the Software and marketing solutions. Though there are some of the apps like Vaniday which are providing great software soltions to the Salon's.

\section{User Requirement Analysis}

In the fast growing digital world everyone needs to get the software and marketing solution to boost their business. Our client needed a sofware solution for managing all the employees and clients with services provided by them and a marketing solution so as to retain the customers for growing there business.

\subsection{Requirements Gathering}
Requirements gathering is also popularly known as requirements elicitation. The primary objective of the requirement gathering task is to collect the requirements from the stakeholders.\\
A stakeholder is a source of requirements and is usually a person, or a group of persons who either directly or indirectly are concerned with the software.\\
\\
Procedures adopted while requirements gathering during the project were:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Interview:} A team of Fusion Salon, Ludhiana delivered the requirements to the Auribises Developers team.
	\item \textbf{Scenerio Amalysis:} The different use cases and functionality of the app were discussed. It includes the discussion on Main panel and followed by transaction history for a Salon.
	\item \textbf{Task Analysis:} The technologies to be used in Frontend and Backend were discussed.
	\item \textbf{Studying Documentation}: The documentation of various cloud technologies were studied and discussed with the Project Mentor. Finally, we agreed on using \textbf{Google Firebase} and \textbf{Google Cloud Platform} as our cloud technology.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Salon Admin need an Android phone with good internet connection.
	\item Android phone needs to have atleast 1 GB Ram and atleast 2GB of external usable memory.
	\item Android phone should have android os version "Kit-Kat" or above.
\end{itemize}
\section{Feasibility Study}
A feasibility study is used to determine the viability of an idea, such as ensuring a project is legally and technically feasible as well as economically justifiable. It tells us whether a project is worth the investment—in some cases, a project may not be do-able. There can be many reasons for this, including requiring too many resources, which not only prevents those resources from performing other tasks but also may cost more than an organization would earn back by taking on a project that isn’t profitable.\\
\\
The application is fully feasible. It just needs a working internet connection and android 4.0 and above. It is fully feasible if it is also deployed on a large scale.\\
The application can also be upgraded further and can be deployed on large scale depending upon the need of business plan.\\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Technical Feasibility :} The app is fully feasible on technical terms. I have android studio and required 8 GB Ram for development purpose.\\
	I will use Firebase cloud to deploy backend as it is free for inital and small projects.\\
	The version control system is completely free and the website Github.com is also free for Open Source Projects.
   \item \textbf{Economic Feasibility :} The app is fully economically feasible as it has free and open source tools being used while developing the system.\\
   The Firebase Cloud technology is free till 10K hits in a day. So, intially around 6-7 months after releasing the project, it is expected to have a user base of around 10K people. Later on, If the user base increases, the revenue of product will also increase and further resources can be purchased.
   \item \textbf{Legal Feasibility :} The app doesn't violates any legal rights and will credit the author of open Source Library used while developing the project.\\
   The project will be available in open source under \textbf{GPLv3} license.\\
   \\
   \textbf{What is GPLv3 License?}
   \begin{itemize}
   	\item The source code must be made public whenever a distribution of the software is made.
   	\item Modifications of the software must be released under the same license.
   	\item Changes made to the source code must be documented.
   	\item If patented material was used in the creation of the software, it grants the right for users to use it. If the user sues anyone over the use of the patented material, they lose the right to use the software.\\
   \end{itemize}
 
   \item \textbf{Operational Feasibility : } As the app satisfies the functional and non functional requirements, the app will be fully operational once it releases.
   
   \item \textbf{Scheduling Feasibility : } The project release targets for different versions are practical and have plenty of time develop and debug the app before release.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Objectives of the Project }
\begin{itemize}
	\item The project is developed to give a software solution and a marketing solution to the Salon Admin.
	\item The main motive behind developing the project is to rescue the Salon from hectic calculations. The app will help Salon to increase their revenue.
	\item This app will provide us with a large database of the customers which can be used to analyse and run ads accordingly.
\end{itemize}

\section{Database Design}
The database is a NoSQL Database. The data is stored in Tree data structure.\\
\subsection{NoSQL Database}
\textbf{What is NoSql Database?}\\
\\
NoSQL is an approach to database design that can accomodate a wide variety of data models, including key-value, document, columnar and graph formats. NoSQL, which stand for "not only SQL," is an alternative to traditional relational databases in which data is placed in tables and data schema is carefully designed before the database is built. NoSQL databases are especially useful for working with large sets of distributed data.\\
\subsection{NoSQL vs. RDBMS}
The NoSQL term can be applied to some databases that predated the relational database management system, but it more commonly refers to the databases built in the early 2000s for the purpose of large-scale database clustering in cloud and web applications. In these applications, requirements for performance and scalability outweighed the need for the immediate, rigid data consistency that the RDBMS provided to transactional enterprise applications.

Notably, the NoSQL systems were not required to follow an established relational schema. Large-scale web organizations such as Google and Amazon used NoSQL databases to focus on narrow operational goals and employ relational databases as adjuncts where high-grade data consistency is necessary.

Early NoSQL databases for web and cloud applications tended to focus on very specific characteristics of data management. The ability to process very large volumes of data and quickly distribute that data  across computing clusters were desirable traits in web and cloud design. Developers who implemented cloud and web systems also looked to create flexible data schema -- or no schema at all -- to better enable fast changes to applications that were continually updated.\\
\textbf{Key-value stores}\\
Key-value stores, or key-value databases, implement a simple data model that pairs a unique key with an associated value. Because this model is simple, it can lead to the development of key-value databases, which are extremely performant and highly scalable for session management and caching in web applications. Implementations differ in the way they are oriented to work with RAM, solid-state drives or disk drives. Examples include Aerospike, Berkeley DB, MemchacheDB, Redis and Riak.\\
\textbf{Document Databases}\\
Document databases, also called document stores, store semi-structured data and descriptions of that data in document format. They allow developers to create and update programs without needing to reference master schema. Use of document databases has increased along with use of JavaScript and the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), a data interchange format that has gained wide currency among web application developers, although XML and other data formats can be used as well.  Document databases are used for content management and mobile application data handling. Couchbase Server, CouchDB, DocumentDB, MarkLogic and MongoDB are examples of document databases.\\
\textbf{Wide-column stores}\\
Wide-column stores organize data tables as columns instead of as rows. Wide-column stores can be found both in SQL and NoSQL databases. Wide-column stores can query large data volumes faster than conventional relational databases. A wide-column data store can be used for recommendation engines, catalogs, fraud detection and other types of data processing.  Google BigTable, Cassandra and HBase are examples of wide-column stores.\\
\textbf{Graph stores}\\
Graph data stores organize data as nodes, which are like records in a relational database, and edges, which represent connections between nodes. Because the graph system stores the relationship between nodes, it can support richer representations of data relationships. Also, unlike relational models reliant on strict schemas, the graph data model can evolve over time and use. Graph databases are applied in systems that must map relationships, such as reservation systems or customer relationship management. Examples of graph databases include AllegroGraph, IBM Graph, Neo4j and Titan.\\
\textbf{Evolution of NoSQL}\\
Berkeley DB was an influential system in the early evolution of NoSQL database usage. Developed at the University of California, Berkeley, beginning in the 1990s, Berkeley DB was widely described as an embedded database that closely supported specific applications' storage needs. This open source software provided a simple key-value store. Berkeley DB was commercially released by Sleepycat Software in 1999. The company was later acquired by Oracle in 2006. Oracle has continued to support open source Berkeley DB.\\
Other NoSQL databases that have gained prominence include cloud-hosted NoSQL databases such as Amazon DynamoDB, Google BigTable, as well as Apache Cassandra and MongoDB.\\
The basic NoSQL database classifications are only guides. Over time, vendors have mixed and matched elements from different NoSQL database family trees to achieve more generally useful systems. That evolution is seen, for example, in MarkLogic, which has added a graph store and other elements to its original document databases.  Couchbase Server supports both key-value and document approaches.  Cassandra has combined key-value elements with a wide-column store and a graph database. Sometimes NoSQL elements are mixed with SQL elements, creating a variety of databases that are referred to as multimodel databases.

\label{Chapter:4}

\section{Introduction to Languages}
\subsection{Front End}
\textbf{XML}\\
XML is used as to design beautiful UI to give user a beautiful experience. Now a days, an app business is more dependent on how interactive, beautiful and simple your UI is.\\
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used to describe data. The XML standard is a flexible way to create information formats and electronically share structured data via the public Internet, as well as via corporate networks.\\
XML code, a formal recommendation from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), is similar to Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Both XML and HTML contain markup symbols to describe page or file contents. HTML code describes Web page content (mainly text and graphic images) only in terms of how it is to be displayed and interacted with.\\
XML data is known as self-describing or self-defining, meaning that the structure of the data is embedded with the data, thus when the data arrives there is no need to pre-build the structure to store the data; it is dynamically understood within the XML. The XML format can be used by any individual or group of individuals or companies that want to share information in a consistent way. XML is actually a simpler and easier-to-use subset of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), which is the standard to create a document structure.\\
The basic building block of an XML document is an element, defined by tags. An element has a beginning and an ending tag. All elements in an XML document are contained in an outermost element known as the root element. XML can also support nested elements, or elements within elements. This ability allows XML to support hierarchical structures. Element names describe the content of the element, and the structure describes the relationship between the elements.\\
An XML document is considered to be "well formed" (that is, able to be read and understood by an XML parser) if its format complies with the XML specification, if it is properly marked up, and if elements are properly nested. XML also supports the ability to define attributes for elements and describe characteristics of the elements in the beginning tag of an element.\\
Applications for XML are endless. For example, computer makers might agree upon a standard or common way to describe the information about a computer product (processor speed, memory size, and so forth) and then describe the product information format with XML code. Such a standard way of describing data would enable a user to send an intelligent agent (a program) to each computer maker's Web site, gather data, and then make a valid comparison.\\
XML's benefits sometimes appeared revolutionary in scope shortly after it was introduced. However, as a concept, it fell short of being revolutionary. It also fell short of being the panacea. The over-application of XML in so many areas of technology diminished its real value, and results in a great deal of unnecessary confusion. Perhaps most damaging is the predictable behavior of many vendors that look to recast XML using their own set of proprietary extensions. Although some want to add value to XML, others seek only to lock in users to their products.\\
XML's power resides in its simplicity. It can take large chunks of information and consolidate them into an XML document ‑ meaningful pieces that provide structure and organization to the information.\\
\textbf{Java}\\
In the back end,JAVA is used. Collection and Genrics concepts are mainly used. Java is one of the world's most important and widely used computer languages, and it has held this distinction for many years. Unlike some other computer languages whose influence has weared with passage of time, while Java's has grown.\\

As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 11 million developers using and working on it.\\
Applications of java:\\
Java is widely used in every corner of world and of human life. Java is not only used in softwares but is also widely used in designing hardware controlling software components. There are more than 930 million JRE downloads each year and 3 billion mobile phones run java.\\
Following are some other usage of Java :
\begin{itemize}
	\item Developing Desktop Applications.
	\item Web Applications like Linkedin.com, Snapdeal.com etc.
	\item	Mobile Operating System like Android.
	\item	Embedded Systems.
	\item Robotics and games etc.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Android Platform}\\
The Android platform is an open source mobile development platform. It gives you access to all aspects of the mobile device that it runs on, from low level graphics, to hardware like the camera on a phone. With so many things possible using Android, you might wonder why you need to bother with XML. It is not that working with XML is so interesting, it is working with the things that it enables. XML is commonly used as a data format on the Internet. If you want to access data from the Internet, chances are that the data will be in the form of XML. If you want to send data to a Web service, you might also need to send XML. In short, if your Android application will leverage the Internet, then you will probably need to work with XML. Luckily, you have a lot of options available for working with XML on Android.
\subsection{Back End}
\textbf{Firebase}\\
Web and mobile application often require back-end code to execute tasks like: sending out notifications or processing long running tasks (e.g. scaling images etc). In the traditional approach this back-end code is running on a server.\\
Recently Google’s Firebase introduces a new functionality which is called Cloud Functions. With this new service Firebase offers a scaleable solution for running back-end code in the cloud. Running code in the cloud has various advantages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item You do not need to run and maintain your own server.
	\item You do have an isolated code base for back-end code.
	\item You only get billed for the actual executing time of you code.
	\item The cloud infrastructure is highly scaleable.\\
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Triggers}\\
The functions you write can respond to events generated by Firebase and Google Cloud features. We will call these features triggers. Before starting to develop our first cloud functions let’s explore the most common triggers you can use for Cloud Functions in the following.\\
\\
\textbf{Realtime Database Triggers}\\
With Realtime Database Triggers we’re able to respond to changes in the Firebase Realtime Database. To do so we need to register for events on a specific database path like:

functions.database.ref('/foo/bar')\\
The functions.database.ref function is called and the database path we would like to register for is passed in as a parameter.

It’s also possible to define a part of the path as a wildcard by surrounding this part with curly braces, like you can see in the following:

functions.database.ref('/profiles/{userID}')\\
If you’re just using the ref function, your registering for all events which are write, create, update and delete. If you just want to subscribe to one event you can use the following functions in addition:

onWrite(): is activated when the data is created, destroyed, or changed\\
onCreate(): is activated when new data is created\\
onUpdate(): is activated when data is updated\\
onDelete(): is activated when data is deleted\\
E.g. if we only want a cloud function to be executed if a new user profile unter /profiles/ is created we’re able to register an event handler with the following code:

exports.newUserCreated = functions.database.ref('/messages/{userID}').onCreate(event => { ... });\\
In this case the userID value can be accessed with event.params.userID inside the event handler function.

\section{Supporting Languages}

	\subsection{GIT}
	what is Git? Why Git? What makes Git so popular? We have the answers to all your questions. Just read on!
	
	Git is a Version Control System (VCS), a tool which is an extremely smart choice to use even if it sounds too overwhelming. Simply put, a VCS is a group of files with monitored access. What does that mean? Let's consider a small example to help you understand.
	
	If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a VCS is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.
	
	Many people's version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they're clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you're in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don't mean to.
	\subsection{Android Studio}
	It’s an Android focused IDE, designed specially for the Android development. It was launched on 16th May 2013, during Google I/O 2013 annual event. Android studio contains all the Android sDK tools to design, test, debug and profile your app. By looking at the development tools and environment, we can its similar to eclispe with the ADT plug-in but as I have mentioned above its android focused IDE, there are many cool features available in Android Studio which can foster and increase your development productivity.
	
	One great thing is that it depends on the IntelliJ Idea IDE which is proved itself a great IDE and has been using by most all the Android engineers.\\
	\textbf{From Where to download?}\\
	You can download Android Studio from the android developer site:\\ http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html
	\\
	\textbf{Gradle Build System}\\
	Android Studio uses Gradle as the foundation of the build system, with more Android-specific capabilities provided by the Android plugin for Gradle. This build system runs as an integrated tool from the Android Studio menu, and independently from the command line. You can use the features of the build system to do the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Customize, configure, and extend the build process.
		\item Create multiple APKs for your app, with different features using the same project and modules.
		\item Reuse code and resources across sourcesets.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Along with these API, some inbuilt methods of android sdk and Java are also used.

\section{Testing}
Software testing is a critical element of the ultimate review of specification design and coding. Testing of software leads to the uncovering of errors in the software functional and
performance requirements are met. Testing also provides a good indication of software reliability and software quality as a whole. The result of different phases of testing are evaluated and then compared with the expected results. If the errors are uncovered they are debugged and corrected. A strategy approach to software testing has the generic characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Testing begins at the module level and works outwards towards the integration of
	the entire computer based system.
	\item Testing and debugging are different activities, but debugging must be accommodated in the testing strategy.
	\item Different testing techniques are appropriate at different points of time.
\end{itemize}
Testing of the app is done by JUnit tester provided inbuilt in the android studio.
\\
The app is also tested in realtime environment.\\
It has passed all the tests conducted by Junit and in realtime sucessfully.
\\
The app has also been tested on custom user inputs.
\subsection{Unit Testing in Android}
A unit test verifies in isolation the functionality of a certain component. For example, assume a button in an Android activity is used to start another activity. A unit test would determine, if the corresponding intent was issued, not if the second activity was started.
A unit tests for an Android application can be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item local unit test - which runs on the JVM
	\itemAndroid unit test - which runs on the Android runtime
\end{itemize}
If they run on the JVM, they are executed against a modified version of the android.jar Android library. In this version all final modifiers have been stripped off. This makes it easier to use mocking libraries, like Mockito.
The local unit tests of an Android project should be located in the app/src/test folder.
\subsection{Required dependencies in the Gradle build file}
To use JUnit tests for your Android application, you need to add it as dependency to your Gradle build file.\\
dependencies {
	// Unit testing dependencies\\
	testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'\\
	// Set this dependency if you want to use the Hamcrest matcher library\\
	testCompile 'org.hamcrest:hamcrest-library:1.3'\\
	// more stuff, e.g., Mockito\\
\subsection{Writing tests to run on the Android device}
The Android testing API provides hooks into the Android component and application life cycle. These hooks are called the instrumentation API and allow your tests to control the life cycle and user interaction events.

Under normal circumstances your application cannot control the life cycle events and the user drives the application. For example, if Android creates your activity the onCreate() method is called. Or if the user presses a button your corresponding code is called. Via instrumentation you can control these events via your test code. For example, your instrumentation test can start the activity. Afterwards, it can call the finish() and restart the activity to test if the instance state of the activity is correctly restored.

Instrumented unit tests are unit tests that run on Android devices and emulators instead of running on the Java virtual machine. These tests have access to the real device and its resources and are useful to unit test functionality which cannot be easily mocked by mocking frameworks. An example is a test which validates a Parcelable implementation.

An instrumentation-based test class allows you to send key events (or touch events) to the application under test.

\section{Conclusion}
The product which we developed was implemented and tested with data and were found to be error free. Also, it is found that the product will work successfully. We tried to make the product maximum user friendly. All the necessary validations are carried out in this project, so that any kind of users can make use of this product and a necessary message makes them conscious of the error they have made. This product is developed keeping scalability in mind. Additional modules can be easily added when necessary. The software is developed with modular approach. All modules in this system have been tested separately and put together to form the main system. Finally the system is tested with data and everything worked successfully.
\section{Future Scope}
The app has been developed keeping in mind of future feature additions.\\
The app can be integrated with BHIM UPI in near future to get and recieve payments.\\
The App has main moto to increase revenue of salon and make them earn money more in less time. I hope,the App will achieve its aim of development and will generate a great revenue for developer and Salon.
